Pu(R)est Web Server
===================

Before running for the first time make sure all the Visual C++ Runtimes in the redist folder are installed as Lua and C Libraries Pu(R)est uses requires them.

- Start the server by running the startServer.bat file.

- If you want to configure the server edit the cfg.lua file in the cfg dir. (DefaultConfig.lua is in '/lua/Config' as an example and a backup if you mess up)
